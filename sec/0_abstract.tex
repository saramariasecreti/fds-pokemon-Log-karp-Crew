\begin{abstract}
We investigate the prediction of competitive Pokémon Generation~1 battles using machine learning techniques. We develop a feature set combining static Pokémon attributes with dynamic battle-state information extracted from the first 30 turns. Logistic Regression, XGBoost and ensemble strategies are evaluated through extensive cross-validation.
