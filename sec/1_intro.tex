\section{Introduction}

This project focuses on predicting the outcome of competitive Pokémon Generation~1 OU battles using machine learning. The dataset, derived from the first 30 turns of real human-vs-human matches, contains team information, early battle dynamics and final outcomes. Competitive Pokémon represents a challenging prediction task due to imperfect information, status effects, switching mechanics and highly asymmetric Pokémon roles. For these reasons, carefully designed feature engineering and model selection are crucial.

Our objective was to construct a model based on feature creation, pruning, model optimisation and ensemble evaluation. The goal was to improve generalisation on unseen battles while maintaining a stable predictive structure.
